scripts to help with troubleshooting and other useful tasks. 

FindAllErrors.bat - updated Feb 3, 2024 for version 2.11 
USAGE: 
Simply place the file in your install directory  or drag and drop your Cyberpunk 2077 folder on top of the .bat wherever it may be. The script will dig through the folder
for logs, extract any error messages and print them to a new file called FilteredLogs.txt for easy troubleshooting.
